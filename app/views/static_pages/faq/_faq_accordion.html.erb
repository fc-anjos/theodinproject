In reality, The Odin Project is for anyone who wants to work as a web developer, do freelancing work, build a startup, or just hack together a homepage for yourself.  All the tools you need are here. <strong>You should consider yourself fairly competent with personal computers and open to using a non-Windows based Operating System.</strong></p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">We’ve built an in-depth curriculum designed to take you 100% of the way to becoming a web developer. Many other resources out there teach you just the basics of programming.  With The Odin Project you’ll create your own websites, games, and social media sites.</p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">The curriculum has also been designed in a modular fashion, making skimming through lessons a breeze.</p>

          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">We won't have any of this 'Learn it all in two days!' BS.  You can't start from scratch and learn true web development in such a short period of time and you know it.  It's highly unlikely that you'll be employable after a weekend workshop or a one-month part-time course.</p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">On the other hand, you don't necessarily need to put in 4 years getting a computer science degree.  80% of what they cover won't be used during a typical web developer's early career and it's not necessary to get hired.  So why not learn the 20% and learn the rest while you're getting paid on the job?</p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">We've essentially distilled down what you most need to learn to hit that employable level, but it's still a healthy dose of learning.  There is no good way to estimate how long it will take you to reach that point, and we don't have any good way of getting data on how long it takes on average anyways.  If you're naturally more technical or come from a technical background, it may be a bit faster.  If you're less technical or brand new to all this, it will take longer.  Don't despair!  When you think about it, that's pretty much the same learning curve you had to climb to learn anything worthwhile so far in life.</p>

          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">All students are initially enrolled into the <a href='courses/foundations'>Foundations Course</a>. This will give you a chance to explore several of the languages and technologies you’ll need to know on your journey to becoming a web developer. Foundations introduces HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and more. We’ve also created mini-projects that give you a chance to test your new knowledge by building your own applications and websites! Once Foundations is complete, students have two paths to choose from: <a href='paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails'>Fullstack Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href='paths/full-stack-javascript'>Fullstack JavaScript</a></p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">The Full Stack Ruby on Rails path takes a back-to-front approach to fullstack development. We start with a <a href='/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby'>strong foundation in Ruby</a> and an understanding of databases before migrating into <a href='courses/ruby-on-rails'>Ruby on Rails</a> (which is a framework built using Ruby). Then you'll polish your front-end skills with a journey into <a href='courses/html-and-css'>HTML and CSS</a> before learning to make your websites flow, load quickly and look great with <a href='courses/javascript'>JavaScript</a>.</p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">The Full Stack Javascript path maintains our front-end momentum from Foundations by delving into <a href='courses/javascript'>Javascript.</a> Once you've got a solid foundation here, you'll take a deeper look at front-end design with <a href='courses/html-and-css'>HTML and CSS</a> before taking your JavaScript skills to the server-side with Express and MongoDB in <a href='courses/nodejs'>NodeJS</a>.</p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">Along the way in either path you’ll learn Git and deployment so you can build your own portfolio, collaborate with others, and see your work on the web. Finally, The Odin Project will provide you with opportunities to work with legacy codebases and open-source projects. We’ll also cover areas specifically intended to help when you’re <a href='courses/getting-hired'>looking for employment</a>.</p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">As you may have noticed, there is considerable overlap between the two paths with the only difference between them being the choice of back-end technology. They both guide you through harnessing the power of <a href='https://reactjs.org/'>React</a> along with software development paradigms such as Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven Development. More importantly, both paths will equally allow you to develop your own skills as a fullstack web developer.</p>

          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">The Odin Project is different from other online programs in that it pulls the best resources from around the web and compiles them to create a complete curriculum.  In many other programs the material is formatted to meet their specific curriculum.  This means that not all of the lessons are top-notch. The Odin Project sidesteps this downfall by pulling various free resources from around the web and compiles them in one place.</p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">The Odin Project also attempts to develop your problem solving skills when it requires you to install programs on your local computer.  As developers, programming errors frequently arise and knowing how to decipher error messages is critical.  These problem solving skills are frequently ignored by other programs.</p>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-500 mt-4">Lastly, The Odin Project is project based.  Other programs require you to simply input the correct answer. It is difficult to retain any knowledge by learning the bare minimum syntax. The Odin Project is designed with projects built from the ground up giving you real-world experience that you can use to build your portfolio and get hired as a web developer!</p>
